    <h2> Welcome to Patagonia </h2>
    <div class="para-hiking">
      <p>On South America’s southern frontier, nature grows wild, barren and beautiful. Spaces are large,
        as are the silences that fill them. For the newly arrived,
        such emptiness can be as impressive as the sight of Patagonia’s jagged peaks, pristine rivers and dusty backwater oases. In its enormous scale, Patagonia offers a wealth of potential experiences and landscapes.
      </p>

     <p>In Patagonia it’s the silence that hits you first. Then the landscapes – the snow-dusted mountains rising up like dollops of whipped cream; the shimmering lakes; the aquamarine icebergs that float past giant, jagged glaciers, crashing and calving their way into the milky blue water below.
     </p>
     <span class="untitle">These landscapes have been luring in explorers and mountaineers for centuries, but they aren't just for hardcore trekkers. Patagonia offers a softer side, too: horse rides in lush green estancias, strolls through pine-carpeted forests, cultural explorations in tiny rural villages, boat trips around staggering ice fields.
        In fact this sprawling, diverse region is ideal for anyone wanting to chill out and tune in to vast, untouched wilderness, seasoned hiker or not. For those who fall into the latter group – or those who just want some down-time in between treks – we’ve put together a guide to some of the best alternative experiences to enjoy in and around the Argentine towns of Bariloche and El Calafate.

      <img class="para-img" src="https://lonelyplanetwp.imgix.net/2018/05/Bariloche_Picnic_Argentina_cs-cdbaf839e826.jpg?fit=min&q=40&sharp=10&vib=20&w=1470" alt="Two hikers face a lake with rolling green hills behind it" class=" stack__article__image is-landscape">
     </div>
     <span class="untitle">Back on the mainland you’ll find plenty of other forested trails. Standouts include the path to Lago Escondido, a ‘hidden lake’ peeping out from the trees and framed by snow-glazed mountains, and Bahía de Los Troncos, a totally deserted, rocky bay set close by. Both are part of the Nahuel Huapi National Park.
        You can easily explore the area independently but for a walk with a twist try Constellations, who offer guided tours with unexpected surprises along the way - from mate tasting in the depths of the forest to a surprise picnic laid out beneath the trees, whisky tasting by the water’s edge to a local Argentine playing the bagpipes in a kilt. Enough said. </span>

      </div>
      <span class="untitle">Elsewhere in the national park you’ll find Estancia Peuma Hue, a cosy eco-lodge offering the likes of horse riding, kayaking, wine tasting, cooking, rafting, yoga and even tango lessons across 500 acres of nigh-on untouched land. The owner welcomes you with open arms – and a delightfully warm log fire – and the food is excellent; think pea soup followed by fresh, deliciously light trout, all served with vegetables organically grown in the gardens. You can stay overnight in one of several guest lodges, and it’s easy to get to at a 25-minute drive from the town.
      </span>

      <span class="untitle">Bariloche is known for its chocolate heritage thanks to the Swiss, German and other European settlers who came in the mid-20th century following the war. Today chocolate shops scatter the area, including VanWynsberghe Chocolates, a family-run, Belgian chocolatier who offer tasting workshops from a quaint, wood-panelled chalet a short drive from the town (Av. Bustillo).
        Here you’ll get a fascinating insight into the history and production process while gorging on smooth, creamy produce from different regions, before indulging in their most-prized delicacies; chocolate spiced with pepper and cardamom, and metallic-colored truffles flavored with forest fruits and lavender.
